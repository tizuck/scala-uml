## What it can do

This project can generate UML class diagrams from Scala programs without being dependent on the scala compiler. 
That means you can obtain class diagrams of work in progress files and also standalone files that would not compile on their own.
However, it is also possible to generate class diagrams to multiple directories of a public github repository.
The project takes into account not only the relationships of the classes but also the package definitions. 

Scala-uml evolved from a master thesis in which stereotypes were inserted for all scala-specific features in the context of a UML profile.

- **Input**: Folder of Scala files or a config file targeting a public github repository
- **Output**: UML class diagram of the files as an svg-image or in the format of class diagrams of [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/de/class-diagram)

## How to use it

At the moment there is no release. However, this project is planned to be a console application and it can allready respond to a few console commands.
Until there is an actual console application, in order to use it you need to get the repository and start the application with `sbt "run <commands>"`.   

**Commands available:**

|Command|Functionality|
|-------|-------------|
|-f,--files \<path\>   | Directory of input Scala files|
|-o,--output  \<path\>  | Directory of output class diagram |
|-n,--name \<name\> | name of the output file |
|-t,--textual | states that the output format should be in the `.puml` format of PlantUML class diagrams |
  |-e,--exclude r \<regex\> | Excludes classes or packages from the diagram that match a given regular expression <regex>. The regular expression is matched on the package + name. If you want to delete anything in a package named "org::com::foo" you can use (org::com::foo.*). More options are planned here :) |
|-g,--github \<path to config\> | Processes directories of a github repository stated in a config file. More infos on config files [here](#config) |

## How it works

<a name="config">
  
## Github Config

```Java
name = "kivy-astmanip"
owner = "theorydudes"
directories = {
  type="directories",
  dir-entries=[
    {type = "entry", path = "src/main/scala/com/github/theorydudes/model"}
    ]
}
```
At the moment only public repositories can be used. The config must include the `name` of the repository and the `owner` and also a list of directories you want to consider in the visualization. In this case, there is only one directory `model`. You can just add entries in the list of `dir-entries`.
